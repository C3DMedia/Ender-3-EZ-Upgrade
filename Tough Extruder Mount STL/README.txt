# Summary

This thing allows you to mount an E3D Titan or Titan clone to a CR-10 in the stock extruder location. Unlike mounting the Titan directly in the stock location, with this mount you won't loose any Z height and the bowden tube will still exit to the side instead of the front which prevents kinks, etc.

Additionally you will need:
4 - m3 nuts
4 - 6-8mm m3 screws, if you use 8mm you will probably need at least one washer per screw as well to keep them from bottoming out on the motor.

# Post-Printing

Press fit the 4 m3 nuts into the nut cavities then build the Titan on the mount following E3D's instructions. Insure that you build it with both the motor connector and bowden tube exiting the right side as shown:

When built simply attach it to the bottom of the original extruder mount, run the extruder motor connector behind the leadscrew and plug it in, and insert your bowden tube.
